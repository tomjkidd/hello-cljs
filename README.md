# hello-cljs

A project to learn how the clojurescript compiler works

## Goal

The goal of this series is to get a feeling for _how_ your ClojureScript 
code turns into JavaScript code that runs in the browser.

It is meant to be a guided tour of the internals to create intuition for
where to look when you encounter situations that you don't understand so
that when you are in that situation you remain calm and can reason through
how to get your code working again.

NOTE: It is a work in progress...

### Assumptions about the Reader

* comfortable with shell commands
* comfortable with managing creation of files in a clojure project.

### FYI

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

This project uses git tags to checkout small pieces of the project at a time 
to get complete snaptshots of code that correspond to each chapter.
